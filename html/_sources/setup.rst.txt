FLEXPART simulations
---------------------

FLEXPART simulations are controlled with with template files in :file:`flexpart_simulations/`. Some settings are predefined in the :file:`*_template` files, `${var}` are adaped for each run with the python template library.
Per default, the particle positions during the backward simulation are dumped every 3 hours.


HYSPLIT simulations
---------------------

HYSPLIT backward trajectories are required, a 10-day 27-member ensemble setup is recommended. Please note that HYSPLIT itself is not provided within this package (The binary to run is `hyts_ens` with the respective `CONTROL` file).
Meteorological input data for HYSPLIT are taken from the GDAS1 dataset (<https://www.ready.noaa.gov/gdas1.php>) provided by the Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) of the U.S. National Weather Serviceâ€™s National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).
An trajectory is calculated every 3h in steps of 500m. Conveniently the input trajectories are placed in the :file:`trajectories` directory.

Following setting provide a starting point:
